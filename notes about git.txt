first we use 
1=> git init
2=> git add index.html (for single file addition in git)
3=> git add . ( for all files adding in the git )
4=> git commit (to commit the file/s in the git. after commiting the file we also have to add discription to do this we press i and write discription. then press "esc" then press ":" and then "wq")
	(there we can also use the 2nd method of commiting the file/folder)
   i.e. git commit -m 'another way of committing' 
 
5=> create .gitignore file and add the path of that file which we don't want to add in our git project.
6=> can also add the complete folder into .gitignore repositry
7=> git branch <branchName> (to create branch)
8=> git checkout <branchName> (to move into another branch)
